# 1U Mute
A signal mute (momentary and latching) in a convenient 1U package.

status: design

## About
I made this into a small 1U module, because I figured it would be nice to have a couple of them handy in my utility row (just like the LPG!). I've design them according to the [Intellijel 1U specification.](https://intellijel.com/support/1u-technical-specifications/)

## Remarks
Err.. none? It has a cool window in the panel that shows polarity of the signal passing through. The module is designed to use regular mono-polar LEDs, rather than bi-polar ones, so you can select your own LED's for + and -!

## BOM
