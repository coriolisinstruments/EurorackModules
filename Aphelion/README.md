# Aphelion
A dual-band parametric compressor that uses vactrols.

status: design (pre-breadboard)

## About
Another stompbox-adaptation for eurorack. However, we've dropped the bypass switch (YAGNI), adapted it to eurorack power and level and made sure everything fits within 6 hp.

## Remarks
Even though the PCB uses the footprint of premade vactrols, it is much cheaper (and fun) to make your own. You can find many tutorials online on making these, such as [SynthDiyGuy's DIY low-pass gate tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOnvSQpoGY)

We've used 5539 photoresistors (or LDRs) with flat-top 5mm so-called "super-bright" green LEDs.

The construction of this module is slightly different than our others. With this one, the board is mounted perpendicular to the front panel with the pots and jacks fixed to the front panel rather than the PCB. The jacks and pots are then connected to the board with (jumper)cables. Simple, but effective! This does mean this module is a bit deeper (about 50mm) than others.
