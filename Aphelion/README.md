# Aphelion
A dual-band parametric compressor that uses vactrols.

status: design (pre-breadboard)

## About
Another stompbox-adaptation for eurorack.

## Remarks
Even though the PCB uses the footprint of premade vactrols, it is much cheaper (and fun) to make your own. You can find many tutorials online on making these, such as [SynthDiyGuy's DIY low-pass gate tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOnvSQpoGY)

We've used 5539 photoresistors (or LDRs) with flat-top 5mm so-called "super-bright" green LEDs.
