## About

Like the other modules in the 1Utilities series, this module is designed according to the [Intellijel 1U specification.](https://intellijel.com/support/1u-technical-specifications/)

## Remarks

It is a multiple? There are many like it, but this one is mine?

Nothing fancy or noteworthy. It is only 6hp and an easy build.
