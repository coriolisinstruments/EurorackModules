# EurorackModules

Open-source eurorack synthesizer modules. All our schematics and pcbs are developed with [KiCad.](http://kicad.org/)

## 1U modules

These are simple (passive) utility modules, designed to fit the Intellijel 1U spec. They are often smaller (6 or 8HP) so you can use them to fill gaps in your system. Except for the Multibus... that one takes up an entire row.
