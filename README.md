# EurorackModules

Open-source eurorack synthesizer modules.

## 1U modules

These are simple (passive) utility modules, designed to fit the Intellijel 1U spec. They are often smaller (6 or 8HP) so you can use them to fill gaps in your system.

### LPG

### Mute

A signal mute (momentary and latching) in a convenient 1U package.

## Regular (3U) Modules

Just your regular sized eurorack modules.

### Binary Pulsar

A dual wide range voltage controlled low-frequency oscillator.

### Corona
