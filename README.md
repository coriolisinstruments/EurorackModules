# EurorackModules

Open-source eurorack synthesizer modules. All our schematics and pcbs are developed with [KiCad.](http://kicad-pcb.org/)

## 1Utilities modules

These are simple (passive) utility modules, designed to fit the Intellijel 1U spec. They are often smaller (6 or 8HP) so you can use them to fill gaps in your system.
